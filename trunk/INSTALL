BUILDING FROM THE SUBVERSION TRUNK
* Windows Prequisites:
 * Visual Studio 2003
 * Python
 * py2exe
 * MozillaBuild (http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Windows_Build_Prerequisites)

 Launch the MozillaBuild 7.1 batch file. (You may have to run this as an Administrator
 on Windows Vista.) Run the commands in that shell.

 If you don't have a copy of Visual Studio 2003, you can download the Python
 source code and compile it yourself. Python C extensions must be built with
 the same compiler as the Python interpreter.

On all platforms:
 $ python setup.py build

To install on Unix:
 $ sudo python setup.py install
