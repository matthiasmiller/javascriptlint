Running from the Command Line
=============================

Running JavaScript Lint from the command line allows integration with build and source control systems. It also allows batching lint jobs.

You can run JavaScript Lint in two modes: using built-in default settings or using settings from a configuration file. For the latter, the name of the configuration file is passed on the command line. The sample configuration file (jsl.default.conf) documents how to enable or disable warnings.

The names of the files to process can be specified on the command line, in the configuration file, or both. The sample configuration file demonstrates how to use wildcards and recursion to specify which files to lint.

Run jsl without parameters for usage.
