## [JavaScript Lint 0.1k Released](__BASENAME__)
_Sat, 24 Dec 2005 18:56:35 +0000_

This release includes a number changes.

__Enhancements:__

* JavaScript Lint warns if the default case is not at the end of the switch statement.

* Control comments can now use the `/*jsl:keyword*/` syntax in addition to the `/*@keyword@*/` syntax. The new syntax is recommended for interoperability with JScript conditional compilation, although the traditional syntax is still supported.

* The "missing break" warning can be disabled for the last case in a switch statement. The presence of this _break_ is merely stylistic preference.

* The "missing semicolon" warning can be disabled when anonymous functions are assigned to variables and properties (such as function prototypes). Code such as the following can optionally be allowed:

>
    function Coord() {  
        this.x = function() {  
            return 1;  
        }  
	}
	Coord.prototype.y = function() {
	    return 0;
	}

__Bug Fixes:__

* The "undeclared identifier" warning for variables has been updated to reflect the ECMA specification. The following code no longer issues a warning:
  > 
	function getX() { return x; }
	var x;

* Scripts with circular _import_ directives no longer incorrectly report undeclared identifiers.
