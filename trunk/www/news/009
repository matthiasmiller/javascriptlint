## [JavaScript Lint 0.1i Released](__BASENAME__)
_Wed, 16 Nov 2005 14:28:54 +0000_

This release has a more specific warning for _else_ statements that may be intended for one of multiple _if_ statements (it previously warned that nested statements should use curly braces to resolve ambiguity):

>
	`if (i)`
	`if (j) func1();`
	`else func2();`

The warning against duplicate case statements now correctly handles case statements with string literals.

This release fixes a bug that caused a "Bus error" on Mac OS X and a segmentation fault on Solaris 5.9; JavaScript Lint has now been compiled and run on those operating systems. If Mac users are interested in precompiled binaries, I will consider making them available for download on the website.

Available from the [download page](/download.htm).
