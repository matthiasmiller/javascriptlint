## [JavaScript Lint 0.1l Released](http://www.javascriptlint.com/news/012)
_Mon, 02 Jan 2006 22:05:25 +0000_

This release includes a new warning for useless comparisons (for example, x == x).

This release also improves the use of the _fallthru_ control comment when used in the final case in a switch statement. The "undeclared identifier" fix in the 0.1k release is now applied to both global and local variables declarations.

Available from the [download page](http://www.javascriptlint.com/download.htm).
